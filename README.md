Liquid Glass for BigSur 26 RC2
Repo for the Liquid Glass Wallpaper Helper for Rainmeter

So what does it do?
It's a helper App for the Big Sur Rainmeter skin: https://www.deviantart.com/fediafedia/art/Big-Sur-26-for-Rainmeter-846882462

Once ran from the + Icon context menu, it will pre-blur your wallpaper with a very realistic Liquid Glass exactly where your widgets are.
Demonstration:

Pros:
Does not run in memory (runs only once)
Run any time you want if you moved your widgets or changed wallpaper
Fast!
Open Source (No viruses pretty sure)

Cons:

Not actually real-time blur, but who wants to waste 20% of their CPU on that?
Need to manually run it if you change your wallpaper or move your widgets

I will soon release a generic version that could be used with any Rainmeter skin, RocketDock, etc
