Liquid Glass for BigSur 26 RC2
=======================
![Preview](https://github.com/fediaFedia/BigSurLiquidGlass/blob/main/preview.png)

Repo for the Liquid Glass Wallpaper Helper for Rainmeter

So what does it do?
It's a helper App for the Big Sur Rainmeter skin: https://www.deviantart.com/fediafedia/art/Big-Sur-26-for-Rainmeter-846882462

Once ran from the + Icon context menu, it will pre-blur your wallpaper with a very realistic Liquid Glass exactly where your widgets are.
The widgets and wallpaper are pretty static, there isn't any movement or animation so it looks pretty good, and I think it's a pretty good idea compared to real-time blur (On my iPad 10 it actually lags, hope the final version doesn't)

Demonstration:

Pros:
Does not run in memory (runs only once)
Run any time you want if you moved your widgets or changed wallpaper
Fast!
Open Source (No viruses pretty sure)

Cons:

Doesn't support two monitors (yet), although you could use some tool to set the wallpaper separately for one
Not actually real-time blur, but who wants to waste 20% of their CPU on that?
Need to manually run it if you change your wallpaper or move your widgets

I will soon release a generic version that could be used with any Rainmeter skin, RocketDock, etc
